# ft_printf

## What is ft_printf?:
### It is the third project in 42 Cursus. My ft_printf is a collection of funtions to create my own printf. It manage diferent types (d, i, x, X, p, c, s) and some flags (- 0 * . %). 

### Currently some changes in the 42 Cursus make this project easier and the new students do not manage any flags.  You can check the original subject of this project in english or spanish.
